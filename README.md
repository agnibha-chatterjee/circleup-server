# CircleUp Server

## Getting Started

To get the app running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
- pnpM - A fast, disk space efficient package manager (I highly recommend using pnpm, run this to install it `npm install -g pnpm`)
- An .env file is required to run this project, which for obvious reasons has not been tracked in version control

### Contents of env

```
MONGO_URI=
PORT=
```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agnibha-chatterjee/circleup-server.git
